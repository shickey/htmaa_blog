<h1>4 - 3D Printing & Scanning</h1>
<p class="project-short">Knots</p>

<div class="project-content">
<p>This week was as much about battling with CAD software as it was about actually 3D printing and scanning objects. Our assignment was to print a small object that could not have been made with a subtractive process (i.e., something with overhangs, nested parts, etc).</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>In thinking about what sorts of objects would be interesting to print, I started thinking about interesting topological surfaces. My first thought was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane">real projective plane</a>, but then quickly switched to thinking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle">Klein bottle</a> since it has some clearer embeddings in three dimensions. Given the mathematical nature of the project, I thought this would be a good time to experiment with an f-rep tool like Antimony.</p>

<h2 id="battling-with-cad">Battling with CAD</h2>

<p>After messing around a bit with the interface and scripting language, I started trying to figure out how to define a complex mathematical object in an Antimony node. In my first attempt, I created a point set from parametric equations and drew it as a wireframe on the screen. This looked kind of cool, but I realized that this is actually counter to the model of a program like Antimony (i.e., I hadn’t actually defined a shape using a mathematical expression; instead I used a mathematical expression to spit out a series of points). This meant I had no way to connect the object into other nodes in the graph and was therefore, basically useless.</p>

<div class="row media-row">
  <a class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12" href="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/klein-spiral.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="week-gallery">
    <img src="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/klein-spiral.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>I then found a polynomial equation for an embedding of the Klein bottle and used the function node in Antimony to model it. This worked okay, but when I went to export it as a mesh, the folded boundaries turned into kind of a mess (which probably makes sense given the weird-ness of the shape).</p>

<div class="row media-row">
  <a class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12" href="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/klein-embedding.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="week-gallery">
    <img src="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/klein-embedding.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>From there, I went back to square one and thought about what else I could model in the same vein, but less topologically complex. I then thought about mathematical knots and specifically, the trefoil. After tracking down this paper, I tried to implement the surface in a function node. However, converting the function to prefix notation was…shall we say…less than fun, and once I got Antimony to parse it, the surface still wouldn’t render correctly.</p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>I then wondered if I could simply draw the path as a point set (like I did with the Klein bottle) and somehow extrude a circle along it to create the solid. Once again, having not learned from my mistake the first time, I successfully drew the path, but then couldn’t do anything with it.</p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>From here, I decided I was trying to do something Antimony wasn’t made to do, so I looked into other solutions. I found a <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Macro_3D_Parametric_Curve">FreeCAD macro for drawing curves from parametric equations</a> so I decided to explore that route next.</p>

<div class="row media-row">
  <a class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12" href="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/freecad-trefoil-path.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="week-gallery">
    <img src="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/freecad-trefoil-path.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>Getting the curve to draw wasn’t all that hard, but turning it into a solid proved to be more difficult. I don’t know if this was my own ignorance, or weird UX decisions in the software, or some combination of the two, but getting a circle to extrude correctly along the path was far more painful than it should be (why doesn’t FreeCAD have a simple way to rotate an object in a plane other than the one it was drawn in??!?!?). At one point, I was going back and forth between Fusion and FreeCAD to try to get the thing I wanted to happen and I even looked into switching to Solidworks (unfortunately, Windows-only). Finally…FINALLY…I got a decent extrusion and exported it as a mesh.</p>

  <a class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12" href="/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/img/04-3d-printing-and-scanning/freecad-trefoil-surface.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="week-gallery">

  </a>
</div>

<p>At long last, I used the mesh tools in Fusion 360 to clean up the surface into a nice trefoil.</p>
